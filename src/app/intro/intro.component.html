      <p class="glass-card">
        Merge sort is a classic, efficient, and stable comparison-based
        sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort
        elements. It works by recursively splitting the array (or list) into
        two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves
        back together.

        <h2>Divide</h2>
        <p>
          Recursively divide the array into two halves until each subarray
          contains a single element (or is empty), which is trivially
          sorted.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content2 glass-card">
        <h2>Conquer</h2>
        <p>
          Merge the sorted subarrays to produce new sorted subarrays until
          you have the complete, sorted array.

        <h2>Space Complexity</h2>
        <p>O(n) due to the extra space needed for merging.</p>

        <h2>Stability</h2>
        <p>
          Merge sort is a stable sort, meaning it maintains the relative
          order of equal elements.
